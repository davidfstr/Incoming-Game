# Incoming <small>- The Game</small>

In this game you try to shoot falling bombs before they crash down to Earth and explode. You get points for destroying bombs but lose points for firing unnecessary shots.

I wrote this game as an experiment to write a non-trivial program in [Elm], a concept language for demonstrating [functional reactive programming].

Take a look at this game's source code if you are interested in reading a moderately complex Elm program.
